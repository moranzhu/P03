      <p class="paragraph">When designing user interfaces, I always start with doing quick sketches and making wireframes, which allow me to have several options in mind.
      Then, I would compare them to find their strengths and weaknesses. User's needs and their using experiences are also considered at the same time. After combining and refining wireframes, I
    usually could get a successful design.</p>

      <p class="paragraph">I tried both list view and grid view when sketching. Although, grid view can show more drink choices at once,
      it takes user extra clicks to add in to the cart. Thus, I decided to go with list view, which can reduce user's effort and show information more clearly.
    Moreover, since the expected delivery time is one of the key factors influencing whether user would like to place and order. I decided to place it on the main browsing page.</p>

      <p class="paragraph">For the customization page, I noticed that cost is a key factor influencing customer's decision. So, I chose to find a way
      to show them all the choices and cost changes at the same time without scrolling to help them making decision.</p>
