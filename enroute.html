      <h1 class="subheading">THE IDEA</h1>
      <p class="paragraph">Vancouver, with a mild weather and numerous attractions that clustered in the downtown area, is one of the most livable and walkable city in the world. Taking a trip is always enjoyable, but planning one can be tedious and annoying. To invite people to take the environmental friendly way to explore this beautiful city, we created Enroute to help travellers and newcomers to plan their trips and explore the city more easily.</p>

      <h1 class="subheading">RESEARCH</h1>
      <p class="paragraph">In order to provide a good using experience, we put our target users as top priority. I participated in conducting user interviews and summarizing their inputs. Based on the results,
      we made the journey map which provides us a better understanding of our user's planning processes and needs. We noticed the planning stage is always a frustration to them, therefore it should be the focus
    point of Enroute. Meanwhile, there are also many opportunities during the trip that we could pay attention to improve their travelling experiences. Those findings lead our feature design and interaction design.</p>

    <div class="shortP">
      <h1 class="subheading">FEATURES</h1>
      <p class="paragraph">Based on the research findings, we decided to not only focus on smoothing the planning stage, but also have the following features to make the journey more meaningful and memorable.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">After confirming the features, we created the application flow map to aid our interface design. The map helps making sure that the user can navigate smoothly in the app.</p>

      <h1 class="subheading">INTERFACE DESIGN</h1>
      <p class="paragraph">During the interface design stage, we started with sketching and making wireframes and dedicated ourselves into constantly refining our design according to the results from user testing.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">I was in charge of the home page and the pages for the three features. After finished the wireframes, we had a group critique which helps refining each other's works. For instance, based on the discussion,
      I decided to use card layout for each attractions as it provides more hint to invite the user to click it. Also, the visible navigation bar was used instead of the "Filter" button to help users to find their interested attractions more easily.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="shorterP">
      <p class="paragraph">For the feature pages, I added more details on the button for AR function to provide users more information about the views. Since we believe there are no real usages for fast forward and fast reverse buttons for the audio guide function, I redesigned the player window to make it functional but smaller in size.</p>

      <h1 class="subheading">PROTOTYPE</h1>
      <p class="paragraph">After several rounds of iterations, we got our final mockups. In order to run the detailed user testings to see more potential problems and present the app to others in a more clear way, we used Flinto to make prototypes.</p>

      <h1 class="subheading">REFLECTION</h1>
      <p class="paragraph">This five-week project provides me an opportunity to work in a fast-paced setting. It not only practices my UI design skills, but also teaches me a lot of UX design methods,
      such as doing user interviews, making affinity diagram, and creating personas and journey map. Also, I learnt that it is important for UI designers to understand the needs of the users in order to
    produce effective interfaces. Running user testing is also crucial for revising the design. It is a great way for designers to receive feedbacks and discover practical problems from users.</p>
